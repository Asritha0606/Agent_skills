propinf:
  category: molecular_property_prediction

  description: >
    Predicts chemical and ADMET-related properties for small
    molecules using global platform models or user-provided
    custom models. Supports uncertainty estimation and
    applicability-domain analysis.

  when_to_use:
    - molecules are already defined as SMILES
    - ADMET or physicochemical properties must be predicted
    - candidate molecules need to be ranked or filtered
    - model confidence or applicability must be assessed
    - custom or project-specific property models are required

  requires:
    - smiles_dataset
    - prediction_models

  optional_inputs:
    - uncertainty_estimation
    - applicability_domain_analysis

  produces:
    - predicted_property_values
    - uncertainty_metrics
    - applicability_domain_flags

  allowed_when:
    - property_prediction_requested
    - molecular_evaluation_workflow
    - no_structure_modification_required

  forbidden_when:
    - de_novo_generation_requested
    - molecular_editing_or_optimization_requested
    - docking_or_dynamics_requested
    - retrosynthesis_or_reaction_planning_requested

  constraints:
    - predictions depend on model training domain
    - uncertainty reflects model confidence, not experimental error
    - applicability-domain flags should be considered in prioritization
    - does not modify or generate molecular structures

  notes:
    - ideal for downstream evaluation of generated libraries
    - combine with screening tools for ranking and pruning
    - custom models enable project-specific endpoints


automl:
  category: custom_model_training

  description: >
    Trains a custom regression or classification model for
    molecular property prediction using user-provided
    SMILES–property datasets. Supports AutoML-based
    model selection and feature engineering.

  when_to_use:
    - no suitable pretrained model exists for the desired property
    - users provide labeled SMILES–property datasets
    - project-specific or proprietary endpoints must be modeled
    - custom prediction models are required for downstream inference
    - experimental data needs to be converted into reusable predictors

  requires:
    - labeled_smiles_dataset
    - prediction_task_type
    - feature_representation

  optional_inputs:
    - dataset_split_strategy
    - specific_model_selection
    - data_transformation_method

  produces:
    - trained_property_model
    - prediction_artifacts
    - uncertainty_estimates

  allowed_when:
    - model_training_requested
    - labeled_training_data_provided
    - custom_property_endpoint_defined

  forbidden_when:
    - no_labeled_data_available
    - direct_property_prediction_requested
    - molecular_generation_or_editing_requested
    - docking_or_simulation_requested

  constraints:
    - model quality depends on dataset size and quality
    - scaffold-based splits may reduce apparent performance but improve realism
    - trained models must be validated before production use
    - does not perform inference on new molecules directly

  notes:
    - outputs are intended for reuse in property inference workflows
    - combine with inference tools to apply trained models
    - uncertainty estimates reflect model confidence, not experimental noise


phcore_gen:
  category: pharmacophore_generation

  description: >
    Generates pharmacophore hypotheses by extracting
    interaction features from ligand structures or
    protein–ligand complexes. Identifies key functional
    groups and spatial constraints relevant for binding.

  when_to_use:
    - protein–ligand complex structures are available
    - binding interactions must be abstracted into features
    - hypothesis-driven ligand design is required
    - pharmacophore-based screening or generation is planned
    - interpretability of binding interactions is important

  requires:
    - protein_ligand_structure

  optional_inputs:
    - feature_selection
    - ligand_identifier

  produces:
    - pharmacophore_hypothesis_file
    - feature_summary_table
    - reference_structure_artifacts

  allowed_when:
    - structural_binding_information_provided
    - interaction_feature_extraction_requested
    - property_abstraction_workflow

  forbidden_when:
    - no_structural_data_provided
    - direct_property_scoring_requested
    - de_novo_molecule_generation_requested
    - docking_or_dynamics_requested

  constraints:
    - hypothesis quality depends on input structure quality
    - extracted features represent interactions, not affinity
    - does not evaluate or rank molecules directly
    - output is descriptive rather than predictive

  notes:
    - often used upstream of pharmacophore-based generation tools
    - multiple hypotheses may be generated for complex systems
    - validate hypotheses using known active ligands when possible
