Evobind:
  category: peptide_binder_design

  description: >
    Designs peptide binders against a target protein using
    sequence-level input and structure-guided optimization.
    Generates peptide–protein complex models, interaction
    metrics, and optimized peptide sequences.

  when_to_use:
    - peptide binders against a specific protein are required
    - interface-focused binding optimization is requested
    - peptide–protein interaction design is the primary goal
    - affinity maturation or binder discovery workflows
    - structure-guided peptide evaluation is desired

  requires:
    - target_protein_sequence

  optional_inputs:
    - interface_residue_positions
    - peptide_length_constraints
    - cyclic_peptide_constraints
    - evolutionary_alignment_file

  produces:
    - peptide_protein_complex_structures
    - peptide_binder_sequences
    - interaction_metrics_summary

  allowed_when:
    - peptide_binding_requested
    - interface_specific_design_requested
    - binder_discovery_workflow
    - protein_target_sequence_available

  forbidden_when:
    - general_peptide_generation_requested
    - property_prediction_only_requested
    - protein_structure_prediction_only_requested
    - small_molecule_design_requested

  constraints:
    - requires a target protein sequence as primary input
    - produces predictive, not experimentally validated, complexes
    - binding scores and structures are model-derived approximations
    - computational cost increases with peptide count and length

  notes:
    - prefer this tool when binding specificity matters more than diversity
    - interface residue selection strongly influences design outcomes
    - downstream ranking or validation is recommended
    - suitable for therapeutic peptide and binder engineering pipelines


Stability_Analysis:
  category: protein_interaction_analysis

  description: >
    Analyzes protein–protein complex stability and interaction
    energetics using the FoldX energy model. Computes interaction
    energies, shared contacts, and stability scores for specified
    chain combinations within structural complexes.

  when_to_use:
    - protein complex structures are already available
    - interaction stability needs to be quantified
    - comparing energetic quality of multiple complexes
    - identifying stabilizing or destabilizing interface features
    - post-design validation of binders or complexes

  requires:
    - protein_complex_structure
    - chain_selection

  optional_inputs:
    - reference_interaction_identifiers
    - multiple_complex_structures

  produces:
    - interaction_energy_metrics
    - stability_scores
    - shared_interaction_analysis

  allowed_when:
    - structural_complex_analysis_requested
    - interaction_energy_evaluation_requested
    - binder_or_complex_validation_workflow
    - FoldX-compatible structures provided

  forbidden_when:
    - structure_prediction_requested
    - sequence_design_requested
    - peptide_generation_requested
    - small_molecule_analysis_requested
    - docking_or_dynamics_simulation_requested

  constraints:
    - operates only on provided PDB structures
    - does not modify or optimize structures
    - energy values are model-derived estimates
    - accuracy depends on structural quality and preparation

  notes:
    - prefer this tool after binder or complex design steps
    - ideal_interactions help contextualize energetic results
    - useful for ranking and filtering candidate complexes
    - not a substitute for experimental stability measurements


graphdta:
  category: binding_affinity_prediction

  description: >
    Predicts ligand–protein binding affinity or activity using
    graph-based deep learning models. Accepts ligand SMILES and
    protein sequence information to estimate interaction strength
    in either regression or classification mode.

  when_to_use:
    - rapid affinity estimation is required
    - screening large ligand libraries against protein targets
    - early-stage prioritization before docking or dynamics
    - binding likelihood needs to be predicted without structures
    - data-driven interaction modeling is preferred

  requires:
    - ligand_smiles
    - protein_sequence_or_uniprot_id

  optional_inputs:
    - activity_prediction_mode
    - batch_ligand_inputs

  produces:
    - binding_affinity_predictions
    - activity_class_predictions

  allowed_when:
    - ligand_target_pairs_provided
    - affinity_or_activity_estimation_requested
    - structure-independent prediction is acceptable
    - early filtering or ranking workflow

  forbidden_when:
    - binding_pose_prediction_requested
    - docking_or_dynamics_simulation_requested
    - structure-based interaction analysis required
    - experimental validation explicitly requested

  constraints:
    - predictions are model-based approximations
    - does not generate binding poses or interfaces
    - accuracy depends on training domain similarity
    - protein structure is not explicitly considered

  notes:
    - prefer this tool before expensive structure-based methods
    - regression mode is suited for potency ranking
    - classification mode is useful for activity filtering
    - results should be validated with downstream analysis
