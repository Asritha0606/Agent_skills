# Skill: Property Prediction and Modeling

## Domain
Small Molecule Design

## Cluster
Tools for predicting ADMET, solubility, permeability, toxicity, binding-related properties, and other physicochemical or biological attributes of small molecules. This cluster also includes workflows involving custom or project-specific property models.

## Skill Description

Property Prediction and Modeling focuses on **evaluating and characterizing existing small molecules** by estimating their chemical, biological, and developability-related properties. Unlike generative or optimization skills, this skill does not create or modify molecular structures. Instead, it provides **quantitative and qualitative assessments** that guide decision-making across the drug discovery pipeline.

This skill is invoked when the agent must determine how a molecule is likely to behave in biological or experimental contexts. Typical use cases include predicting ADMET profiles, solubility, permeability, metabolic liabilities, toxicity risks, drug-likeness metrics, or other custom-defined endpoints relevant to a project.

The skill operates in a **purely analytical mode**. It consumes molecular representations such as SMILES strings, molecular descriptors, or structured datasets, and produces structured predictions, scores, or classifications. These outputs are used to rank, filter, prioritize, or annotate molecules generated by upstream workflows.

In addition to standard property prediction, this skill supports **custom modeling workflows**, where pretrained or user-defined models are applied to assess molecules against proprietary or non-standard objectives. This allows the system to adapt beyond generic ADMET prediction and support project-specific success criteria.

Conceptually, Property Prediction and Modeling serves as the **evaluation and validation layer** of small-molecule workflows. It transforms raw molecular candidates into actionable insights that inform downstream optimization, screening, and experimental planning.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- the task involves predicting ADMET, solubility, permeability, toxicity, or related properties
- molecules already exist and do not need to be generated or edited
- candidates must be filtered, ranked, or annotated based on predicted attributes
- custom or project-specific property models need to be applied
- comparative evaluation of multiple molecules is required

## When *Not* to Use This Skill

Do **not** use this skill when:
- the goal is to generate new molecules or explore chemical space
- structural edits, scaffold changes, or optimization are required
- docking, molecular dynamics, or structure-based simulations are requested
- retrosynthesis or reaction planning is the primary objective

## Conceptual Role in the System

Within the overall agent architecture, Property Prediction and Modeling functions as a **decision-support and quality-control layer**. It bridges molecular design and experimental action by providing objective, model-based assessments of candidate molecules.

This skill is commonly used:
- downstream of **Molecular Generation and Optimization** to evaluate candidates
- in conjunction with **Screening and Filtering** to rank or prune libraries
- during **Lead Optimization** to guide iterative improvement strategies

By clearly separating prediction from generation, the system maintains clean reasoning boundaries, modular workflows, and robust agent behavior.

## Expected Outputs

Depending on the selected tool, this skill may produce:
- predicted property values or scores
- classification labels (e.g., toxic vs non-toxic, soluble vs insoluble)
- confidence or uncertainty estimates
- structured CSV or tabular reports suitable for downstream workflows

tools:
### Molecular Property Inference and ADMET Prediction

This tool enables **systematic prediction of chemical, biological, and ADMET-related properties** for small molecules represented as SMILES. It is designed for workflows where molecules already exist and must be evaluated quantitatively rather than generated or modified.

The Molecular Property Inference tool is intended for scenarios where the agent must assess **developability, safety, or performance characteristics** of candidate molecules. Typical properties include permeability, solubility, toxicity indicators, pharmacokinetic proxies, or other project-relevant endpoints. Predictions may be produced using platform-provided global models or user-supplied custom models.

A key capability of this tool is its support for **uncertainty estimation and applicability-domain analysis**. This allows the agent not only to report predicted values, but also to reason about confidence and model validity for each molecule. Such information is critical when prioritizing compounds, identifying risky predictions, or deciding whether further experimental validation is required.

Conceptually, this tool represents the **primary evaluation engine** within the Property Prediction and Modeling skill. It converts molecular representations into structured property annotations that can be used for filtering, ranking, risk assessment, or decision-making in downstream workflows.



### Custom Molecular Property Model Training (AutoML)

This tool enables **training of custom predictive models for small-molecule properties** using user-provided datasets. Unlike inference tools that apply existing models, this capability is invoked when **no suitable pretrained model exists** or when project-specific endpoints must be learned directly from data.

The Custom Model Training tool is intended for workflows where users supply **SMILES–property datasets** and require a tailored regression or classification model. Typical use cases include proprietary bioactivity prediction, custom ADMET endpoints, experimental assay modeling, or organization-specific success criteria that are not covered by standard property predictors.

The tool supports **automated model selection and optimization** through AutoML workflows, allowing the system to choose appropriate algorithms, representations, and transformations without manual intervention. Feature representations may include molecular fingerprints or descriptor-based encodings, and datasets can be split using chemically informed strategies such as scaffold-based partitioning.

Conceptually, this tool represents the **model creation layer** of the Property Prediction and Modeling skill. Models produced here are not final insights themselves, but **artifacts** that enable downstream inference, screening, and prioritization when applied to new molecular datasets.
### Pharmacophore Hypothesis Generation

This tool enables **extraction and construction of pharmacophore hypotheses** from ligand structures or protein–ligand complexes. Rather than predicting numerical properties, it identifies **key interaction features** that define how a ligand is expected to interact with a biological target.

The Pharmacophore Generation tool is intended for workflows where the agent must **abstract binding interactions into a feature-level representation**, such as hydrogen bond donors or acceptors, aromatic centers, hydrophobic regions, or charged sites. These hypotheses capture the essential interaction geometry required for molecular recognition, independent of specific chemical scaffolds.

This capability is especially valuable in **hypothesis-driven drug design**, where understanding *why* a molecule binds is as important as *whether* it binds. Generated pharmacophore models can be reused downstream for ligand screening, pharmacophore-constrained generation, or comparative analysis across multiple ligands or complexes.

Conceptually, this tool functions as a **structural interpretation and abstraction layer** within Property Prediction and Modeling. It transforms structural data into reusable interaction constraints, enabling informed and explainable molecular design strategies without directly generating or modifying molecules.
