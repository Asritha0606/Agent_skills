Backbone_Generation:
  category: structure_modeling

  description: >
    Generates three-dimensional antibody backbone structures for
    heavy or light chains without assigning amino acid sequences.
    Produces framework-level structural scaffolds suitable for
    downstream structure-based design and analysis workflows.

  when_to_use:
    - structural scaffolds are required before sequence design
    - antibody backbone templates are needed for CDR grafting
    - preparing structures for sequence-conditioned design tools
    - structure-first workflows in antibody engineering
    - docking or stability analysis requires backbone geometry

  requires:
    - chain_selection

  optional_inputs:
    - number_of_backbone_models

  produces:
    - antibody_backbone_structures
    - backbone_structure_files

  allowed_when:

  constraints:
    - produces backbone-only structures without side-chain identities
    - does not perform sequence design or mutation
    - not suitable for direct functional inference
    - output quality depends on canonical framework assumptions

  notes:
    - prefer this tool when structural scaffolds are needed early
    - downstream sequence assignment or refinement is expected
    - generated backbones should be validated before high-stakes use


boltz_structure_prediction:
  category: structure_prediction

  description: >
    Predicts three-dimensional molecular structures from biological
    inputs such as protein sequences, DNA sequences, RNA sequences,
    or ligand SMILES representations. Produces PDB-format structural
    models suitable for downstream analysis and modeling.

  when_to_use:
    - structure prediction is required from sequence-level inputs
    - no experimental or template structure is available
    - preparing structures for docking, dynamics, or visualization
    - high-throughput or multi-entity structure generation is needed
    - heterogeneous biomolecules must be processed together

    - at_least_one_biological_input

  optional_inputs:
    - protein_sequences
    - dna_sequences
    - rna_sequences
    - ligand_smiles

  forbidden_when:
    - sequence_generation_requested
    - structure_refinement_requested
    - backbone_only_modeling_requested
    - property_only_analysis_requested

  constraints:
    - predicted structures are approximate and model-derived
    - does not refine or optimize existing structures
    - affinity metadata is model-dependent and not experimentally validated
    - output accuracy depends on input quality and sequence validity

  notes:
    - suitable for exploratory and preparatory workflows
    - downstream refinement or validation is recommended
    - treat outputs as hypotheses rather than final structures


Monomer structure prediction:
  category: structure_prediction

  description: >
    Predicts three-dimensional structures for monomeric proteins
    directly from amino acid sequences. Generates PDB models along
    with structural confidence metrics to support downstream analysis.

  when_to_use:
    - monomeric protein structures are required from sequence input
    - the user provides one or more protein sequences
    - confidence metrics are needed to assess model reliability
    - batch structure prediction is desired
    - preparatory structures are needed for downstream workflows

  requires:
    - protein_sequences_csv

  optional_inputs: []

  produces:
    - protein_structures
    - structure_confidence_metrics
    - structure_summary_table
    - structure_files_archive

  allowed_when:
    - structure_requested
    - protein_sequence_provided
    - monomeric_context_assumed

  forbidden_when:
    - multimeric_or_complex_modeling_requested
    - backbone_only_modeling_requested
    - structure_refinement_requested
    - sequence_generation_requested

  constraints:
    - predicts monomeric structures only
    - does not model protein–protein or protein–ligand complexes
    - output accuracy depends on sequence quality
    - confidence scores are predictive, not experimental

  notes:
    - use confidence metrics to guide downstream decisions
    - low-confidence regions may require refinement or exclusion
    - predicted structures should not be treated as experimental truth





Motif_Scaffolding:
  category: motif_driven_structure_design

  description: >
    Generates protein scaffold structures that preserve a user-supplied
    structural or functional motif. The motif geometry is fixed while
    surrounding regions are sampled to create novel scaffold designs.

  when_to_use:
    - a fixed structural or functional motif must be preserved
    - embedding motifs into new protein scaffolds is required
    - stabilizing catalytic residues or epitopes is the objective
    - immunogen, binder, or enzyme scaffold design workflows
    - local structural constraints must dominate global design freedom

  requires:
    - motif_structure_pdb
    - contig_definition
    - design_targets

  optional_inputs:
    - minimum_scaffold_length
    - maximum_scaffold_length
    - samples_per_target

  produces:

  constraints:
    - motif geometry is strictly preserved
    - scaffold flexibility is limited by contig definitions
    - does not assign or optimize amino acid sequences
    - unsuitable when no explicit motif is provided

  notes:
    - contig definitions strongly influence design outcomes
    - downstream sequence design or refinement is typically required
    - validate motif integrity in all generated scaffolds



fpocket:
  category: binding_site_prediction

  description: >
    Detects and analyzes potential ligand-binding pockets in a protein
    structure. Identifies cavities and computes druggability-related
    metrics, producing ranked pocket summaries and pocket-specific
    structural files.

  when_to_use:
    - a protein structure is available
    - binding-site discovery or analysis is required
    - assessing druggability of a target is the objective
    - preparing structures for docking or virtual screening
    - prioritizing regions of interest on a protein surface

  notes:
    - use predicted or experimental structures as input
    - downstream docking or dynamics is recommended for validation
    - multiple pockets may be identified; ranking should guide selection
